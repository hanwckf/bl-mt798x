Authors of XZ Embedded
======================

XZ Embedded is developed and maintained by
Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>.

Major parts of XZ Embedded are based on code written by Igor Pavlov,
specifically the LZMA SDK <https://7-zip.org/sdk.html>. Without this
code, XZ Embedded wouldn't exist.
